what is Streams?
->Streams in Java, introduced in Java 8, 
->facilitates the processing of collections in a declarative and functional style. 
->They support various operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing,
->when manipulating with data ,  developers can write concise and expressive code using streams

-> They do not modify the underlying data structure(actuall collection)oroginal data source; instead,
the take the data to streams and then do operation over the streams so stream acts like pipleline


Benefits of Using Streams:
The benefits of using streams include 
->improved readability through clear and concise code, 
->the ability to handle complex operations with ease, 
->and the potential for parallel processing which can enhance performance for large datasets.

Stream
*******
Stream is an interface,it is an api which has all the stream methods to invoke this we will
ise stream()  method which is provided by Collection Interface api


The stream() Method
********************
The stream() method is a part of the Java Collection API, 
->utilized to convert a collection into a stream.
-> This method can be called on any collection type, 
such as List, Set, or Map, and 
->it enables the application of stream operations.
 For example, invoking the  stream methods (such as filtering and mapping, which provide a more readable and concise form of code 
 compared to traditional loops.)on a list/set/map this stream()  methods allows developers 
 to process the elements using various stream operations.

 
 
 To work ith lambada exprssion stream has two mechnaism:
 *********************************************************8
 1) filter->works with predicate
 2)map->consumer
